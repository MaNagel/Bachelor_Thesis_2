\chapter{Effect of Vetoing the masked Regions}%\label{make}

The easiest way to exclude the effect of the masked regions, is to veto the effected areas in the detector based in different physics objects.
Those strategies will be described in the following chapter.

\section{Monotop Event Selection}

Events passing the monotop event selection are required to have at least one large-R jet with $p_{\text{T}} > \SI{250}{\giga\electronvolt}$, $m > \SI{50}{\giga\electronvolt}$ and in order to be calibrated $|\eta| < 2.0$.
In Addition $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}} > \SI{200}{\giga\electronvolt}$ and $|\Delta\phi(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}, p_{\text{T}})| > \frac{\pi}{2}$ is required to fulfil the selection.

\section{Performance of different Options}

The following criteria are based on geometrical areas in the $\eta$-$\phi$-plane.
The distance of the jet axes in $\eta$ and $\phi$ to the center of a masked module will be referenced as $\Delta\phi$ and $\Delta\eta$.
The distance of $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ to the center of a masked module is referenced as $\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{miss}}$.

\subsection{Vetoing on large-R jets}

For vetoing based on large-R jets, there will be two options considered.
First is to veto just on the leading large-R jet, as the second is to veto on all large-R jets.
The veto is based in the position of the jet axis and every event with at least one jet pointing into the affected area will be rejected.
A large-R jet is defined to point into a affected region, when $\Delta\phi < 1.05$ and 1.0  $\Delta\eta < 1.45$.
In figure \ref{leadingLargeCut} are the leading large-R jet $\eta$-$\phi$ distributions given, for those events that have been rejected by the vetoing.

\subsection{Vetoing on small-R jets}

Analogously to the veto on the large-R jets, the veto on the small-R jets will be defined.
For the rejection $\Delta\phi < 0.45$ and 1.0  $\Delta\eta < 0.85$ is required.
In figure \ref{leadingSmallCut} are the leading large-R jet $\eta$-$\phi$ distributions given, for those events that have been rejected by the vetoing.

\subsection{Vetoing on $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$}

Another possibility to veto on the masked regions is to use the $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$.
In this case a event will be rejected, when $\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{miss}} < 0.45$ is satisfied.
The resulting $\phi$-distributions of $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and leading large-R jet $p_{\text{T}}$ are given in figure \ref{CutMET}.
